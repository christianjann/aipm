# AIPM — Goals

## Primary Goals

- **Unified project management** — manage tickets from Jira, GitHub, and local sources in a single git-tracked workspace
- **AI-powered insights** — use GitHub Copilot to summarize changes, check ticket completion, and generate project reports
- **Graceful offline support** — every AI feature falls back to structured local analysis when Copilot is unavailable
- **Markdown-first workflow** — all tickets, milestones, and plans are plain Markdown files, easy to read, diff, and version-control

## Secondary Goals

- **Multi-user support** — filter summaries and plans by assignee for team workflows
- **Time horizon planning** — organize work by urgency (now → sometime) instead of rigid priority numbers
- **Automated ticket lifecycle** — detect completed tasks from git history and close tickets interactively
- **Extensible source backends** — support additional issue trackers beyond Jira and GitHub
- **Generated dashboards** — produce milestone plans, kanban boards, and per-user dashboards from ticket data
